So I made another one of these for you. Here are the steps to make it run.

# 1. Install Node.js
The download link is here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

# 2. Download these files.
Just click clone or download. Unzip the downloaded folder.

# 3. Open command prompt
Navigate to this folder in command prompt. The likely file path is C:\Users\soph\downloads\sophiemayo-master\sophiemayo-master.
If that is the file path type: cd C:\Users\soph\downloads\sophiemayo-master

# 4. Install node in Command prompt
When in that folder type: npm install nodejs

# 5. Install a required module.
In that same folder after the last step is done. Type: npm install colors

# 6. Run the file.
Now you are done. In the command prompt, just type: node ily2.js
